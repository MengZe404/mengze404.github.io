Research Title: Improving Students’ Engagement in Learning Mathematics via Automated Assessment System

Supervisor: Dr.Chee Wing Loon, Assistant Professor, School of Mathematical Sciences, UNMC

Grant: Teaching and Learning Seed Fund (UNMC)

This research focused on the implementation of algorithmic and interactive mathematics assessments and studied their potential to enhance personalized learning experiences. The goal is to determine whether the new assessment system improves students’ confidence and engagement in solving mathematics problems.

## Research Outcome
- Created a full set of automated assessment questions on the topic of Linear Algebra for Undergraduate Year 1 students.
- Evaluated the performance of students after practising with the automated assessment questions.
