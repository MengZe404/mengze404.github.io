Research Title: Hill Cipher Modifications and Dynamic Cryptosystem Design (Completed)

Supervisor: Dr.Chee Wing Loon, Assistant Professor, School of Mathematical Sciences, UNMC

## Research Outcome
- Produced a literature review report including a critical analysis of the Hill Cipher cryptosystem and evaluations of its variations proposed in past research.
- Proposed two modifications to the Hill Cipher variations.
- Proposed an algebraic cryptanalysis technique, extending the chosen-plaintext attack.
- Proposed a new cryptosystem (AHC-M) with innovative, dynamic design approach to address the vulnerabilities of existing variations of the Hill Cipher cryptosystem.

## Publication

A conference paper was submitted under review by IEEE International Conference on Cryptography, Security and Privacy.
