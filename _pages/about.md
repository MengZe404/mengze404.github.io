Welcome! I am a mathematics and data science student from [University of Nottingham Malaysia](https://www.nottingham.edu.my/), graduating in 2024 with a **First Class** honours degree.

I am deeply passionate about research and aspire to become a dedicated researcher in the future. I am constantly seeking out research opportunities such as **Research Assistant** and **Visting Student**. Upon completing my undergraduate studies in 2024, I would like to further my academic journey by pursuing an **MPhil or PhD** degree.

I have a wide research interest, ranging from data science, machine learning and NLP. Besides these topics, I also conduct research in applied linear algebra, cryptography and financial mathematics. You can find more about my research experience in [research](research).

Beside research, I am also active in various extra-curriculum activities. In particular, I am the founder of Maths Society in UNMC, and I am also a member of the Chinese Association for Cryptologic Research (CACR) and Quantitative Investment and Data Science Society at HKU.
