I am fully passionate about solving real-world problems using the knowledge I learnt in class and from research. Below you can find some projects I have developed in the past:

## NIST Randomness Test Simulation

This simulation was developed for a workshop to help high school students understand the concept of randomness and statistical testing. Five selected NIST tests were implemented in JavaScript and presented as a website for students to run simulations of their inputted sequences on their devices.

You can find the project website [here](https://mengze404.github.io/STEM-randomness-test/)


## OpenRevise - Resource Sharing Platform

I have worked as a web developer in a GitHub community and contributed to an education resource-sharing platform called [OpenRevise](https://oopdevs.github.io/OpenRevise2/app/pages/master.html). This project aims to provide an easy-to-use platform for students to share their learning materials with others and to get inspiration from other students' sharing. There are also a number of integrated study tools to assist students with their learning and exam revision.
